# Computational Chemistry

## Project Overview

This project is focused on advanced computational chemistry simulations, integrating **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**, **Molecular Dynamics (MD)**, and various quantum chemical calculations. Our work aims to explore molecular behavior, electronic structure, and reaction pathways with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Features

* **DFT Calculations:** Perform electronic structure calculations using ORCA, with support for single-point (SP) and geometry optimizations (OPT).
* **Molecular Dynamics (MD):** Simulate the time-dependent behavior of molecular systems, analyze conformations, and extract thermodynamic properties.
* **Custom Workflows:** Integrate multiple simulation types (DFT + MD) for comprehensive studies.
* **Parallel Computing Support:** Utilize MPI-based execution for high-performance computation on multi-core clusters.
* **Input/Output Management:** Maintain organized structure for input files (`*.inp`, `*.gbw`) and result outputs (`*.out`, `*.log`).
